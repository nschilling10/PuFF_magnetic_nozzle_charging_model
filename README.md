# PuFF_magnetic_nozzle_charging_model
Mathematical model of PuFF-style magnetic nozzle. Nozzle is unique in that in addition to providing thrust, it must also charge the Z-machine that implodes targets
This model captures both these aspects of the PuFF nozzle; the part that provides vehicle thrust and the part that charges up the Z-machine banks.
